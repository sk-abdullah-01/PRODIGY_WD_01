                    communication between all the components, including the CPU, RAM, storage, and peripherals. It
                    contains slots for memory, expansion cards, and storage devices, as well as connectors for power,
                    USB, audio, and more. The motherboard determines the compatibility and performance of a computer,
                    with popular form factors like ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX. Itâ€™s essential for the overall
                    functionality and upgrade potential of a computer system.</p>

                    store data permanently, including the operating system, applications, and files. It uses spinning
                    magnetic disks to read and write data. HDDs are known for their large storage capacities and
                    relatively low cost but are slower compared to SSDs (Solid-State Drives). They connect to the
                    motherboard via interfaces like SATA.</p>

                    data that the CPU needs to access quickly. It allows for fast read and write operations, enabling
                    smoother multitasking and faster performance. Unlike storage, RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its
                    data when the computer is turned off. The more RAM a system has, the better it can handle multiple
                    tasks and large applications simultaneously.</p>

                    It presents everything from text and images to videos and graphical interfaces. Monitors come in
                    various sizes and resolutions, with common types including LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and LED
                    (Light Emitting Diode) screens. Key specifications include screen size, resolution (e.g., 1080p,
                    4K), refresh rate (measured in Hz), and connectivity options like HDMI, DisplayPort, and VGA. The
                    quality of the monitor significantly affects the visual experience when using a computer.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <li>**Keyboard:** Used for typing and inputting commands, a keyboard typically features a layout of
                        keys including letters, numbers, function keys, and special characters. There are different
                        types of keyboards, such as mechanical, membrane, and chiclet, each with a unique feel and
                        response.</li>
                    <li>**Mouse:** A pointing device that controls the on-screen cursor. It allows users to interact
                        with the computer by clicking, selecting, dragging, and scrolling. Mice come in various types,
                        including optical, laser, and wireless, and often include additional buttons for added
                        functionality.</li>
                    <br>Together, the keyboard and mouse enable users to efficiently navigate and interact with a

                <p class="subtag small">A power supply unit (PSU) is a critical component in a computer that converts
                    electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the internal components of the computer. It
                    supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage devices, and other peripherals. The PSU also
                    regulates voltage to prevent spikes and ensure stable power delivery. Key specifications include
                    wattage (which determines how much power it can supply), efficiency ratings (like 80 Plus
                    certification), and the type of connectors it has for different components. A reliable PSU is
                    essential for the stability and longevity of a computer system.</p>

                    rendering graphics and images, particularly in video games, 3D modeling, and other visual computing
                    tasks. Unlike a CPU, which is optimized for general-purpose processing, a GPU has thousands of
                    smaller cores that can process multiple tasks simultaneously, making it ideal for parallel
                    processing. GPUs are essential for high-performance gaming, video editing, and applications
                    involving machine learning. They come as integrated (built into the CPU) or dedicated (separate
                    cards) and connect to the motherboard via a PCIe slot. Major GPU manufacturers include NVIDIA and
                    AMD.</p>
